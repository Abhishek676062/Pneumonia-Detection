Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-ray Images using Convolutional Neural Network and Pretrained Models
This repository contains code and resources for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and pretrained models. The project aims to automate the process of pneumonia detection, assisting healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, it can be obtained from <a href="[https://www.google.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/code/madz2000/pneumonia-detection-using-cnn-92-6-accuracy/input)" target="_blank">Source</a>. The dataset consists of chest X-ray images classified into two categories: pneumonia and normal. The dataset should be organized into the following structure:
